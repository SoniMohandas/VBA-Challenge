# VBA-Challenge
**VBA script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information.
* The ticker symbol.
* Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
* The total stock volume of the stock.
* Conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
* The solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
* The VBA script allows it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running the VBA script once.
